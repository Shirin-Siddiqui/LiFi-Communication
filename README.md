# LiFi-Communication
This Project was Focused on Sending data from one laptop to another using Light as a medium of Communication.

Here We used two NodeMCU's for Serial Communication
They were Connected to LED as Transmitter
and Solar Panel for reciever.
The .exe application was made in Visual Studio using C# which would send text message to Serial Ports and these Serial Ports.
From the Serial Ports the NodeMCU would send data to LED and then Solar Panel on the other would recieve and amplify the signals and send to 
the other NodeMCU and Finally display the Message on the other laptop.
